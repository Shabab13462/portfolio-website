        <p align="justify">Hello, My name is Shabab Ali and I am writing to introduce myself. My interests include
            photography, art, and
            music. I enjoymaking things out of clay and woodworking. I am a native of the United States and have been
            here
            for over 20
            years now. I grew up in pabbi where I attended school. After high school, I moved to Peshawar where I went
            to
            university at abasyn university peshawar During college, it was not easy for me to make friends because I
            was
            shy and quiet. It wasnâ€™t until after college when I started working at engineering that my relationships
            with
            others changed for the better.At work,
            I was able to open up more as well as learn how to communicate better with others by using body language and
            tone of voice
            rather than words alone. This resulted in me being promoted <br>from a part-time employee into an assistant
            manager position
            withintwo years of working there full-time!
        </p>
